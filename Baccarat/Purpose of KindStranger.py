The purpose of the KindStranger program was initially to simulate a basic betting strategy where it uses a machine learning model to predict
outcomes and place fixed bets accordingly. The agent started with a predefined balance and updates it based on whether its bets win 
or lose against the actual game outcomes. 

However, this program can be considered obsolete and does not need to be used/downloaded. BaccaratMain.py uses the same MLM but 
executes it in the main istself. Being the main, it also handles user interaction for placing bets, simulating game outcomes, 
displaying game history, card details, and managing the overall program.
